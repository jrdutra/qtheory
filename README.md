# About The Library
It is a **Python library** implementing the Queueing theory calculations.
As my term paper, I am developing a library, implementing the calculus of queuing theory. This library has the objective of characterising some queuing theory params as the queue arrival rate of clients, attendance rate and others...
Implementing in python, this library receives a input file with queue data and gives the output answers.
For the undergraduate thesis, I had toke some datas in a real queue and submited to the library as a input, to validate this project.
